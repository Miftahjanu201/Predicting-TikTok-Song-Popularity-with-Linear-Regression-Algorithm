# Predicting-TikTok-Song-Popularity-with-Linear-Regression-Algorithm
This project explores how audio features and engagement metrics influence a song’s virality on TikTok.   We use Linear Regression to model and predict popularity scores based on key content and metadata.

Key features:
- Data preprocessing and outlier handling
- Feature engineering (tempo, danceability, loudness, etc.)
- Correlation analysis between audio features and popularity
- Linear Regression modeling with evaluation metrics

Value Proposition
This project provides insights for music labels and creators to understand the factors behind viral TikTok songs.  
It can be extended into a **content-based music recommendation system**.
